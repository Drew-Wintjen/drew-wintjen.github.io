                            <h3><b>The A40's by Astro</b></h3>
                            <p>When I was getting into competitive gaming back in the old Xbox 360. All the pros have Astro headsets. So, I always wanted a pair. The only issue was the price. $250 for a gaming headset. When I got my first job and paycheck I immediately went to best buy and bot my pair of Astro A40’s gen 2. The Astro A40 feature a mix amp that you can control the overall volume and game/chat mix volume. The mix amp allows it to simulate surround sound and allows you to change the audio profile. It was a purchase I never felt buyer’s remorse on. I was in love with. I finally had the headset of the pros. I’m set. So, I thought…</p>

                            <h3><b>Cons</b></h3>
                            <p style="clear: both">For the longest time, I had no cons for this headset. Nothing at all. This all changed once I tried a different headset. The simulated surround sounds are very over hyped. It compresses the audio so much that you miss out on a lot of sound ques that are very faint. With a standard stereo headset, I was able to hear things in more detail I could with the simulated surround sound. Another con was the microphone. Over the years it would just end of dying. Where it would just crackle and sound muffled, or just stop working all together.  </p>

                    <section class="col-md-5">
                        <div class="review-text">
                            <p>It was so bad that Astro started to sell the microphone by itself so people could replace it. Lastly the headband. I had mine break off at the tab that holds it on a couple of times, just from wearing. Astro also sells this piece that you can go buy and replace it. I just used hot glue; it works for the most part.</p>

                            <h3><b>Pros</b></h3>
                            <p>So besides the of the items on the headset just breaking. It was a great headset. My favorite thing about the headset and the main reason by I bought it. Was the fact it looks cool. It is a very nice design. Everything matches everything. I loved it. The mix amp was nice besides the surround sound.  </p>
                            <p>The option to mix the volume of voice and game sound was amazing. It allowed for you to turn down people if you need to hear something important. It also offered a aux cable that could be plugged into anything so you could hear all that audio too.

                        <div class="review-text-bottem">
                    <p> The Astro A40’s even with all the cons, are still my second favorite headset of all time. That more than likely based on the memories I had while wearing that headset. If I hadn’t found the M50x’s by audio techinca I could see myself buying Astro again. The $250 is a big price to pay for audio. I would say if you like the way it looks. Go for it. It makes you feel good when wearing it.  </p>
