                            <h3><b>The G Pro by Logitech</b></h3>
                            <p>The Logitech G Pro Wireless was released in July of 2018. At first many competitive players didn’t think much of it and many casual players never even had it has an option. Taking in the account it’s launch price was $150. But as time went by more and more people where able to use the Logitech G Pro Wireless. It quickly become the forever mouse of many professional and casual players alike. I was one of them, who was skeptical of the price point. But now that I have spent it, I don’t see myself ever using another mouse again for the foreseeable future. </p>

                            <h3><b>Cons</b></h3>
                            <p style="clear: both">This mouse is one of the only mice that I can’t think of many cons. As I sit here looking at the mouse, holding it in my hands. I honestly can not think of a con. It’s not missing any features. It’s using the newest and best technology Logitech has to offer. </p>
                        </div>
                    </section>
                    <section class="col-md-5">

                            <h3><b>Pros</b></h3>
                            <p>With this mouse being in my mind the perfect mouse. It has a lot going for it. Let’s start with the Body. The body is an ambidextrous design and has one of the safest shapes on the market. The Logitech G Pro was designed to work with all hand sizes and grips, and it does that very well. </p>
                            <div class="review-text-seperate">

                                <p>Logitech did something never heard of when making this mouse. They made a wireless mouse under 100 grams. The G Pro comes in at 80 grams. Which is absolutely insane.</p>
                                <p>It’s lighter than most wired mice that don’t have a battery in them. Weighing 80 grams doesn’t hold back the battery life either. Its advertised as 48 hours with the lights on and 60 hours without. I can contest that is very accurate.
                                </p>
                                <p>I don’t remember the last time I’ve charged my mouse. It’s been longer than two weeks and it is just below 33% battery life. </p>

                                <p>Moving on from the shape and weight. The materials used on this mouse are all great. All the buttons feel solid and are clicky. The mouse wheel is one of the best wheels out there. It doesn’t have infinite scroll, but I don’t feel like that would fit this mouse very well. It does offer mouse buttons on bot sides of the mouse. All of which are removeable and customizable. </p>

                            <div class="review-text-bottem">
                                <p>To conclude this mouse, if you want a mouse that will last you a very long time and you will never complain about. This mouse is worth every penny of the $150 price tag. Logitech does come out with limited editions of this mouse every so often. I wouldn’t hesitate to get one if I could get inline before they sell out. This mouse is just that good. It’s the best on the market right now. Wireless is the future and right now no one does it better than Logitech!</p>
