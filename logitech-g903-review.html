                            <h3><b>The G903 by Logitech</b></h3>
                            <p>The Logitech G903 is one of Logitech’s flagship mice in their wireless lineup. The G903 is the upgraded version of the G900. Featuring increased battery time and a better sensor. But at the same time keeping that unique shape. The G903 was my daily driver for the longest time, until I got my hands on the Logitech G Pro wireless. Which I’ll tell you why later when I compare the two. Like always let’s start with the pros and cons.</p>

                            <h3><b>Cons</b></h3>
                            <p style="clear: both">The Logitech G903 may be one of my favorite mice of all time. But it doesn’t fall short in a couple areas. First is the weight. The G903 comes in at 110 grams. Comparing it to its competition makes it look like a brick. Next con, would be the battery life. It has around a 24-hour battery life with the LEDs off. Which don’t get me wrong is plenty for most people. Just feel like they could have improved this with one easy solution. Those are really the only two flaws I have with this mouse.</p>

                             <h3><b>Pros</b></h3>
                            <p>The pros for this mouse are outstanding. My favorite thing about this mouse is the shape. It has a normal mouse shape but then has a cut out right before the mouse buttons. </p>
                            <div class="review-text-seperate">
                           
                            <p>Giving a person like me with a palm grip more of a fingertip grip without having to change my grip. This makes this mouse feel very on point. Another feature that is very unique to this mouse is the scroll wheel.</p>
                            <p> It supports tilt buttons, so if you push the scroll wheel to one side or the other it will activate a click. That you can also remap to anything you like. 
                            </p>
                                <p> The scroll wheel uses Logitech’s Infinite scroll wheel. This technology allows you to toggle between a step mouse wheel, standard mouse, to infinite scroll. This takes away those steps and allows it to scroll as fast as you want. Making it a very seamless and easy scrolling experience.</p>

                            <h3><b>G903 vs G Pro Wireless</b></h3>
                            <p>These two mice are my top two mice of all time. Both have ambidextrous designs. Both have very nice shapes, but different. The G Pro has a very safe shape that will fit most hand sizes and grip types. While the G903 has a very unique shape. I like it, but it does have a large butt on the end of the mouse where your palm sits. Some people don’t like this and can cause some issues with smaller hands.  </p>
                            <p>The biggest thing that makes the G Pro my daily driver is the weight, sensor, and battery life. The weight is around 80 grams, which is insane that a wireless mouse is under 100 grams. The sensor is the HERO sensor from Logitech. Their pride and joy. It is extremely accurate and most of all, efficient. </p>
                            <p>By efficient I mean it uses very little power to operate. Thus, making the battery life the best on the market by a landslide. The G Pro has a 48-hour battery without the LEDs on. But I have gotten much more out of it. I actually haven’t charged my mouse in over two weeks and I play daily for several hours. With all that said. If the G903 had the hero sensor in it. I wouldn’t hesitate to get it. I love the G903 that much. It just needs that one thing.</p>

                            <div class="review-text-bottem">
                            <p>The G903 is a fantastic mouse. If you don’t mind the weight and the battery life. I would highly recommend this mouse. It is a solid mouse in every sense of the word. </p>
