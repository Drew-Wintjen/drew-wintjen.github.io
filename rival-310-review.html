                            <h3><b>The Rival 310 by Steelseries</b></h3>
                            <p>The Steelseries Rival 310 is one of the three flagship mice Steelseries has to offer. It has a right-handed ergonomic grip with larger body size than most mice. The Rival 310 has the best sensor Steelseries has every made. The TrueMove sensor is clamed by Steelseries the be the most precise sensor every created. Even if its sensor is the best. Would that make this mouse right for you? I hope to answer that question.</p>

                            <p>The Rival 300 was my first gaming mouse I owned. I don’t know what about the mouse called out to me, but in 2016 when I found it I instantly fell in love with it. The shape, materials, size, and weight where all perfect for me at the time. So I used that mouse for a very long time. I never even thought about getting a new one. Until finally it started to have a couple issues with the scroll wheel and the size buttons. Around the time these issues started to become more frequent Steelseries where about to release there 310 line of mice. With the Rival and Sensei. So naturally I was very attracted to the new rival. Best sensor every created with better switches and same design, heck yeah, right. Sadly, I was wrong. </p>

                            <h3><b>Cons</b></h3>
                            <p style="clear: both">The cons with this mouse for me outweigh the pros. To start my biggest con for this mouse was the build materials they used. With the rival 310 they went with a rubber grip on the sides of the mouse for more grip over the original 300. These quickly started to lose their grip and even started to peel off the side of the mouse within months of getting it. The cable they used was also very poor material. It was stiff and kinked easily. For some reason I never could get that feeling I had with the rival 300 back with the rival 310. </p>

                            <h3><b>Pros</b></h3>
                            <p>This mouse does have its pros. The pro is that it’s a very good sensor. With that said, every top mouse now a days, has a fantastic sensor and you wouldn’t be able to tell the difference for the most part. Its buttons are good and clicky. Seem like they where for sure a good upgrade from the original.  The biggest pro this mouse has is the price. Right now, you can get this mouse for $50. Which if you are on a budget, I think that helps make this mouse a top choice. </p>
