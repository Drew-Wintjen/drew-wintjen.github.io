                            <h3><b>The EC2-A by Zowie</b></h3>
                            <p>Zowie has always been and staple in esports ever since they where created. All their products where designed for top competitive play. Their mouse line up is no exceptions. When you first take a look at the Zowie EC2-A. It looks very basic. Nothing flashy just a mouse. That’s what Zowie is known for. </p>
                        </div>
                    </section>

                            <p style="clear: both">They cut out the non-necessities and focus on the shape and feel of the mouse in your hand. For instance, the mouse has no programable buttons. You control the DPI with a switch on the mouse. So, you don’t have to worry about having the right software installed to change those settings. The Zowie EC2-A is a very popular mouse amongst CSGO players. It has a right-handed ergonomic grip. It also has a broth the EC2-B which is just a bit larger.</p>

                                           <h3><b>Cons</b></h3>
                            <p>There’s not a lot of bad things to be said about this mouse. Let’s start with the cable. Zowie has never changed their cables ever since they started making them. Which would be fine because it’s a good cable don’t get me wrong. </p>
                            <div class="review-text-seperate">
                            <p>The problem is the revaluation of paracord and “phantom” cables. These cables are made of fabric instead of rubber. So, they are much more flexible, won’t hold as much memory, glide easier, and are much lighter. This would be a very simple change out of the box to do yourself. </p>
                            <p>The bad side of doing it yourself is that it would void any warranty you have, and risk breaking something. Another issue I found with the mouse is the side buttons. They are known for being very flimsy and just overall feel very cheap. 
                            </p>
                                <P>If I had to guess where they had to cut some cost somewhere. I would start with the side buttons. When you press them, they feel very spongy until you finally get the click after you press it all the way down.</P>
                                <h3><b>Pros</b></h3>
                                <p>The Zowie EC2-A has a lot going for it. Let’s start with its shape.</p>

                    <section class="col-md-12">
                        <div class="review-text">
                            
                            <p> Its body is all plastic, no rubber grips or anything like that. It has a glossy finish, so you’ll get very good grip. Then the right-handed grip fits all grip styles. I personally use a palm grip. Next pro is the sensor. It’s a top optical sensor. You won’t have any aim jump or slamming with the mouse at all. Along with a great sensor. The Zowie EC2-A has great M1 and M2 buttons. They have a satisfying click to them and feel very sturdy. </p>
                            <div class="review-text-bottem">
                                <h3><b>Conclusion</b></h3>
                            <p>Overall the Zowie EC2-A is a great mouse for right-handed users. Coming in at $60, it is a very affordable mouse for high level gameplay. If you are looking for a competitive mouse that is built for competitive, I would go straight to Zowie. If you would prefer a different shape or size. I would recommend going to Zowie’s website and checking out the rest of their gaming mouse to find the right one for you. </p>
