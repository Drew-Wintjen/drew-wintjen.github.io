                            <p>The Fnatic Steak Mini is a decent keyboard. It has a good typing expierence for the first few months. But once the keycaps get worn, it's bad.  </p>

                            <h3><b>The Streak Mini by Fnatic Gear</b></h3>
                            <p>The esports organization Fnatic, has had its own peripherals for a while now. Recently they have been revolutionizing their lineup. They started with the keyboards. Before it was the Rush. Now they offer the Streak and Streak Mini. Both options come with your choice of Cherry mx red, brown, and blue. The one I’ll be review will be the mini with Cherry mx blues. The blues offer a heavy click once pressed all the way down. This gives to some people a very satisfying experience. </p>

                            <h3><b>Cons</b></h3>
                            <p style="clear: both">Let’s start with the body. It made of aluminum. But the feet on the back are plastic. I actually had one break on me a couple months after using the keyboard. It broke in half. Other than that, the body is okay. It doesn’t offer very much besides of an open-ended design. Another con is the ABS keycaps. These have been the worse I’ve owned. They got the glosses and feel oily almost. Even after cleaning with rubbing alcohol, the still feel oily.  </p>
                        </div>
                    </section>
                    <section class="col-md-5">
                        <div class="review-text">
                            <p>The last I have is the cable management they implemented. It was great idea. Just poorly executed. They made the usb-c cable plug into the middle of the keyboard via a cut out. This cut out is only routed one way, and very tight. So tight that it started to cut the rubber of the cable.</p>
                            <div class="review-text-seperate">
                            <h3><b>Pros</b></h3>
                            <p>Even with a lot going against this keyboard I still really like it. To start it offers a “gaming mode” this disables the windows key and caps lock. Those of which could tab you out of games, and mess things up. </p>
                            <p>Next is the RGB. It is very vibrant and colorful. The software they made is also very nice because its simple and laid out very well. This keyboard was actually my first tenkey less keyboard. 
                            </p>
                                <p>It was a very nice experience, because I’m already limited on my space. This opened my eyes to the possibilities and other options I have to take into consideration. </p>
                                <h3><b>Conclusion</b></h3>
                                <p>The Fnatic Streak Mini is a good keyboard. Coming in at $100 for the mini and $130 for the larger brother it’s a solid keyboard.  </p>

                    <p> If you do get one, I would recommend changing the keycaps with some third party PBT keycaps. That would make the typing experience much better. I’m excited to see what Fnatic keeps trying to improve from model to model, because the streak is a huge upgrade from the rush. </p>
