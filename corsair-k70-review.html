                            <h3><b>The K70 Mk.2 by Corsair</b></h3>
                            <p>The Corsair K70 Mk.2 was my favorite keyboard for the longest time. The cool design mixed with the Cherry mx silver switches. Made it a very delightful typing experience. Corsair is most famous for making a wide range of pc peripheral and hardware. They are a great company, they offer a wide range of products in several different price points. </p>

                            <h3><b>Cons</b></h3>
                            <p style="clear: both">To start I want so to say that I thought this was going to be my forever keyboard. The one to rule them all. This ended up changing based on two key factors. One was the size. I was used to a tenkey less keyboard forever. So going from a TKL to a full size made my desk feel very small and cramped. The second factor was the design. It’s a very aesthetically pleasing design. With all the lips and edges, it gathered dust, hair, crumbs very easily. </p>
                        </div>
                    </section>
                    <section class="col-md-5">
                        <div class="review-text">
                            <p>Making the cool design very unpleasant to look at, and it was a hassle to clean. Another thing that I disliked was the non-detachable cable. It’s very thick and annoying to move around because its wont bend. The large cable is due to the fact is draws a lot of power compared to other keyboards. It also has a usb pass threw on it. So, you’ll need two usb slots to power it.</p>
                            <div class="review-text-seperate">
                                <h3><b>Pros</b></h3>
                                <p>My favorite thing about the keyboard was the switches. The Cherry mx silvers mixed with the aluminum body. Produced a very pleasing typing experience. Another thing corsair has come to master is RGB. The lighting on the keyboards is very nice. Mix it with their iCue software. </p>
                                <p>You can do many things with the lighting. Including effects on click and even play little games on the keyboard such as snake. The final pro is that the body is made of metal. So, it is very heavy and won’t move on the heaviest of typers.
                                </p>
                                <h3><b>Conclusion</b></h3>
                                <p>My conclusion is that the k70 is a fantastic keyboard. If you have the space and/or need a tenkey on your keyboard.</p>

                            <p>I would say this is a very good option. It offers a very nice typing experience and don’t think you would regret it. If you’re limited on space. Then I would go with something different. Such as the Razer Huntsman TE or any TKL keyboards.</p>
